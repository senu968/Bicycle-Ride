# Write a short description of your application
topic: >
  "Bicycle Ride" A campus-based bicycle hire service that allows students and staff
  to rent bicycles for short-term use via a mobile app. The system
  includes GPS tracking, digital locks, and usage analytics.
  
# For the following sections, you may write multiple paragraphs, each
# with multiple lines, under the key. But be sure *every* line is
# indented at the same level as the first line under the key (see
# `example.yml` for examples).

# Note that the '>' character means the text spanning multiple lines
# should be concatenated into a single paragraph.  Paragraphs are
# separated by blank lines, and *all* lines must be indented.

# Write your assessment of the rivalry between existing competitors.
competitor_rivalry: >
  Competition among bicycle hire services is increasing with the
  rise of sustainable transport options. On-campus, there may already
  be services like Lime or public bike racks used by private bike owners.
  However, few offer a seamless campus-specific system integrated with
  student accounts and low rental rates.

  The rivalry is moderate, but differentiation through convenience,
  affordability, and university integration can help maintain a
  competitive edge.

# Write your assessment of the threat of new entrants.
new_entrant_threat: >
  The entry barriers are moderate. While it's easy to start a bike
  rental operation with enough capital, establishing infrastructure
  like charging stations (for e-bikes), software integration, and
  campus partnerships takes time and negotiation.

  New entrants would need to offer better pricing or service to
  compete, and this can be difficult without volume or subsidies.

# Write your assessment of the threat of substitute products or services.
substitute_threat: >
  Substitute products include walking, skateboards, personal bicycles,
  electric scooters, and ride-share services such as Uber.

  While these substitutes provide flexibility, they may lack the
  affordability and eco-friendliness of a dedicated on-campus bike
  system. Still, in poor weather or for longer distances, users may
  prefer substitutes.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of customers.  
customer_power: >
  Students and staff have alternative modes of transport, giving them
  moderate bargaining power. If the service is not convenient,
  reliable, or fairly priced, they can easily switch to walking or
  using personal bikes.

  However, if the service is deeply embedded in the universityâ€™s
  transport infrastructure, individual customer power decreases due to
  system lock-in and convenience.

# Write your assessment of the bargaining power of suppliers.
supplier_power: >
  Suppliers include bike manufacturers, app developers, and lock
  hardware providers. While there are many suppliers, switching costs
  can be high due to system integration and branding.

  If using e-bikes, battery or charging hardware suppliers might have
  more leverage. However, sourcing from multiple vendors can help
  reduce dependency.

# Write your conclusion regarding the appropriate competitive strategy to pursue, based on
# your assessments above.
competitive_strategy: >
  The appropriate strategy is *differentiation through convenience and
  integration*. By building a campus-specific app, linking with
  student credentials, and offering real-time availability and support,
  the service can stand apart from general public alternatives.

  Additionally, a focus on eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, and
  integration with university transport goals creates a niche that is
  hard for generic providers to replicate quickly.
